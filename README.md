# simpleportscanner
Just a simple port scanner written in Python. I made it because I didn't have privs to install nmap at the time because I was a new employee < 90 days and thought it would be more interesting to code my own port scanner than to ask someone to install nmap for me.

The instructions are simple. Just run "python simpleportscanner.py" and it will prompt for an IP address. It scans for specific tcp ports as is. Edit the code to scan the ports you desire or enter ports on the cli.
